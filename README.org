My Emacs configuration which I strive to keep /simple/ as much as possible:
+ [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] – to manage package configurations
+ [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] – to manage my personal tasks and write short notes for myself
+ [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]] – to work with git repositories

There are few modules written by myself:
+ [[https://github.com/zepp/search-scope-mode][search-scope-mode]] – search and replace things in a scope
+ =typography-mode= – mode to insert various typographic characters

Frankly speaking, I do not want to spend much time configuring Emacs but I have to since there are inconsistent keybindings and poor default settings. It is weird but engaging so I keep doing that.
