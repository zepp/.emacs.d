Here is my Emacs configuration. I strive to keep it /simple/ as much as possible but there are still self-made crutches. Mostly I use Emacs to write notes and articles using [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]].

Directory structure:
- =loadable= - directory for standalone packages those are not available in =MEPLA=
